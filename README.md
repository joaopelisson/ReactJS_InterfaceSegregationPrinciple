# ReactJS | Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) ‚öõÔ∏è

This project explores the **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** within the context of React applications. ISP, one of the SOLID principles, emphasizes that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. By following ISP, you can create more focused and modular components, leading to cleaner, more efficient code that avoids unnecessary dependencies.

## üõ†Ô∏è What is SOLID?

**SOLID** is an acronym for five design principles that help developers create more maintainable and scalable software:

- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) ‚Äî Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## üéØ Objectives

- Demonstrate how to apply the Interface Segregation Principle in React components.
- Show how to design interfaces and props that are focused and specific to the needs of the component.
- Provide practical examples of how to structure a React project following ISP best practices.

## üìÇ What You'll Find

- **Code Example**: React components designed with focused interfaces that adhere to ISP.
- **Modular Design Techniques**: Strategies for creating modular and efficient components that avoid unnecessary dependencies.
- **Best Practices**: Tips for maintaining a clean and efficient codebase by following ISP.
